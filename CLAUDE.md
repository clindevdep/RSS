### Testing & Usage

```bash
# Quick test of scraper functionality
python src/sync_main.py test

# Direct Playwright scraper test
python test_playwright.py

# Full processing workflow
python src/sync_main.py init     # Initialize database
python src/sync_main.py sync     # Sync feed subscriptions  
python src/sync_main.py process  # Process articles
python src/sync_main.py status   # Check system status
```

#### Manual Testing with Real Inoreader Account

To test with your actual Inoreader account:

1. **Set up Inoreader credentials** (choose one method):
   
   **Method A: Environment Variables (Recommended - Fully Automated)**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file in project directory:
   INOREADER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   INOREADER_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```
   
   **Method B: Interactive Login**
   - No credentials needed, browser will open for manual login

2. **Ensure you have an Inoreader account** at https://inoreader.com
3. **Subscribe to some RSS feeds** in Inoreader for testing
4. **Run the test**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python src/sync_main.py test
   ```
5. **Authentication Process**:
   - **With credentials**: Fully automatic login - no user interaction required
   - **Without credentials**: Interactive browser login with manual form filling
6. **Verify the test results**:
   - Should show "✓ Login successful"
   - Should fetch sample articles from your feeds
   - Should display article titles, sources, and metadata

**Note**: The system now supports fully automated authentication. When credentials are provided, the entire login process happens without any user interaction.

## User Rules

- **Keep GitHub records**: Always maintain proper GitHub commit history and branching to enable easy rollback if needed. Create meaningful commits with clear messages to facilitate project recovery and version management.
- **Obsidian.md as PKS**: Obsidian.md is the preferred Personal Knowledge System (PKS) for this project. All integrations and knowledge management features should be designed with Obsidian compatibility as a priority.
- **Clarify assignments through questions**: Often ask questions to make assignments more clear. Use numbered option lists when presenting choices. Ask for free input when needed to better understand requirements.

## Security & Privacy Guidelines

- **NO sensitive information** (API keys, tokens, passwords) should ever be committed to this repository
- All sensitive configuration is stored in local environment files (`~/.env`) 
- Web searches and external API calls should never include private or sensitive data
- Review all code and commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are exposed
