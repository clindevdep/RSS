### Playwright Implementation Details

#### Advantages Over Selenium
- **Better Performance**: Faster startup and execution times
- **More Reliable**: Superior handling of modern web applications and dynamic content
- **Enhanced Session Management**: Advanced storage state persistence including cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage
- **Built-in Waiting**: Intelligent waiting strategies that handle dynamic content loading
- **Network Control**: Better handling of network requests and responses
- **Native Async Support**: Built for async/await patterns with better concurrency

#### Authentication Strategy
- **Automatic Email/Password Login**: Directly fills login forms with credentials from environment variables
- **Multiple Selector Fallbacks**: Robust form detection using multiple CSS selectors for different page layouts
- **Login Verification**: Comprehensive verification using multiple indicators to confirm successful authentication
- **Interactive Fallback**: Falls back to manual browser login if automatic authentication fails
- **Session State Management**: Persists complete browser state between sessions for seamless re-authentication

#### Scraping Strategy

- **Viewport Optimization**: Standard desktop resolution for proper page rendering
- **Security Headers**: Handles modern web security features properly

### Testing & Usage

```bash
# Quick test of scraper functionality
python src/sync_main.py test

# Direct Playwright scraper test
python test_playwright.py

# Full processing workflow
python src/sync_main.py init     # Initialize database
python src/sync_main.py sync     # Sync feed subscriptions  
python src/sync_main.py process  # Process articles
python src/sync_main.py status   # Check system status

# Generate corrected newsletter with proper prioritization
python generate_50_article_newsletter.py
```

#### Manual Testing with Real Inoreader Account

To test with your actual Inoreader account:

1. **Set up Inoreader credentials** (choose one method):
   
   **Method A: Environment Variables (Recommended - Fully Automated)**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file in project directory:
   INOREADER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   INOREADER_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```
   
   **Method B: Interactive Login**
   - No credentials needed, browser will open for manual login

2. **Ensure you have an Inoreader account** at https://inoreader.com
3. **Subscribe to some RSS feeds** in Inoreader for testing
4. **Run the test**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python src/sync_main.py test
   ```
5. **Authentication Process**:
   - **With credentials**: Fully automatic login - no user interaction required
   - **Without credentials**: Interactive browser login with manual form filling
6. **Verify the test results**:
   - Should show "✓ Login successful"
   - Should fetch sample articles from your feeds
   - Should display article titles, sources, and metadata

**Note**: The system now supports fully automated authentication. When credentials are provided, the entire login process happens without any user interaction.

### Topic Scoring System

- Fallback to interactive login if automatic authentication fails

#### Obsidian.md Compatibility
- Markdown file format with YAML frontmatter
- Templater plugin variable support
- Proper file naming and organization
- Link and tag structure preservation

### Scalability Considerations
- Modular design allows independent scaling of components
- Event-driven architecture supports async processing
- Caching strategies to minimize API calls
- Horizontal scaling capability for high-volume processing

## Configuration

The repository includes Claude Code permissions configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` that allows specific bash commands for file exploration.

### Environment Variables

All configuration is stored in a single `~/.env` file in your home directory:

**RSS System Configuration** (stored in `~/.env`):
- `INOREADER_EMAIL`: Your Inoreader account email for automatic login
- `INOREADER_PASSWORD`: Your Inoreader account password for automatic login
- `EMAIL_USERNAME`: Gmail account for sending newsletters
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Gmail App Password for SMTP authentication
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER`: Email provider (default: gmail)
- `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`: Newsletter sender name (default: RSS Newsletter)
- `NEWSLETTER_RECIPIENT`: Default recipient for newsletters

**MCP Server Configuration** (also in `~/.env`):
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Required for Tavily MCP server (web search capabilities)
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: Required for Firecrawl MCP server (web scraping and crawling capabilities)
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Required for GitHub MCP server (repository and file operations)

**Optional Configuration**:

## User Rules

- **Keep GitHub records**: Always maintain proper GitHub commit history and branching to enable easy rollback if needed. Create meaningful commits with clear messages to facilitate project recovery and version management.
- **Obsidian.md as PKS**: Obsidian.md is the preferred Personal Knowledge System (PKS) for this project. All integrations and knowledge management features should be designed with Obsidian compatibility as a priority.
- **Clarify assignments through questions**: Often ask questions to make assignments more clear. Use numbered option lists when presenting choices. Ask for free input when needed to better understand requirements.

## Security & Privacy Guidelines

- **NO sensitive information** (API keys, tokens, passwords) should ever be committed to this repository
- All sensitive configuration is stored in local environment files (`~/.env`) 
- Web searches and external API calls should never include private or sensitive data
- Review all code and commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are exposed
