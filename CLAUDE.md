### Playwright Implementation Details

#### Advantages Over Selenium
- **Better Performance**: Faster startup and execution times
- **More Reliable**: Superior handling of modern web applications and dynamic content
- **Enhanced Session Management**: Advanced storage state persistence including cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage
- **Built-in Waiting**: Intelligent waiting strategies that handle dynamic content loading
- **Network Control**: Better handling of network requests and responses
- **Native Async Support**: Built for async/await patterns with better concurrency

#### Authentication Strategy
- **Automatic Email/Password Login**: Directly fills login forms with credentials from environment variables

#### Manual Testing with Real Inoreader Account

To test with your actual Inoreader account:

1. **Set up Inoreader credentials** (choose one method):
   
   **Method A: Environment Variables (Recommended - Fully Automated)**
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file in project directory:
   INOREADER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   INOREADER_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```
   
   **Method B: Interactive Login**
   - No credentials needed, browser will open for manual login

2. **Ensure you have an Inoreader account** at https://inoreader.com
3. **Subscribe to some RSS feeds** in Inoreader for testing
4. **Run the test**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python src/sync_main.py test
   ```
5. **Authentication Process**:
   - **With credentials**: Fully automatic login - no user interaction required
   - **Without credentials**: Interactive browser login with manual form filling
6. **Verify the test results**:
   - Should show "✓ Login successful"
   - Should fetch sample articles from your feeds with dynamic loading (200+ articles)
   - Should display article titles, sources, and metadata

**Note**: The system now supports fully automated authentication with dynamic content loading. When credentials are provided, the entire login process happens without any user interaction and can fetch 200+ articles for superior newsletter quality.
